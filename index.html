                        I love what I do. I abosultely love my craft -- and it shows.  My work is challenging, rewarding, and a strength of mine. Whether its creating 
                        projects on  a team or my freelance, solo work, I deliver quality creations. Its the act of creating that makes this satisfying and I share that enthuasism
                        with everyone I work with.<Span Id="hide">I have abosultely no idea what I should write on a page like this. None. I don't think its what I wrote though.
                            I need to look at other web dev pages, if I ever find the time.</Span>

                    <p id="wrap"> Time warps for me when I code and I spend most of time doing it. I can go for hours and it feels like minutes. When I do get away from the computer
                        I love to run (marathoner), and connect with others. Time with my family, my dog, and others in the field is important to me. I was raised in NJ, but lucky enough
                        to live in the sunshine state for a few years. Its made me tough, yet friendly.

                    <p>But, enough about me. All you really need to know, is on the <a href="#Portfolio" style="color: #4aaaa5; font-weight: bold;">Portfolio</a> page. Please take a look around.<br>
