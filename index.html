                        I love what I do. I abosultely love my craft -- and it shows.  My work is challenging, rewarding, and a strength of mine. Whether its coding 
                        projects on  a team or my freelance, solo work, I deliver quality creations. Its the act of creating that makes this satisfying and I share that enthuasism
                        with everyone I work with.  
                    </p>

                    <p id="wrap"> Time warps for me when I code and I spend most of time doing it. I can go for hours and it feels like minutes. When I do get away from the computer
                        I love to run (marathoner), and connect with others. Time with my family, my dog, and others in the field is important to me. I was raised in NJ, but lucky enough
                        to live in the sunshine state for a few years. It's made me tough, yet friendly.
